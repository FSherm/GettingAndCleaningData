#Tidy Data of the UCI HAR Dataset
================================

The data located in "tidy.txt" contains the merged data within the "train" and "test" folders located in the UCI HAR Dataset.
The mean() and std() feature variables were selected from these data sets.  For more information on the original feature variables, go to "features_info.txt".  For a list of all of the original features, go to "features.txt"

The data is organized by subject and activity. The subject was retreived from the "subject_test" and "subject_train.txt". The activity was retrieved from the "y_train.txt" and "y_test.txt" and used the names from "activity_labels.txt".

"tidy.txt" 
===============
This file contains 180 observations.  There are 30 subjects.  Each subject performed 6 activities.  Each subject performed each activity multiple times.  Each observation shows the average for all of these times.

The "tidy.txt" data is organized by subject and by activity.  

There are 68 variables reported in "tidy.txt". All variables except for the first 2 are doubles.

subject - (int) subject ID
activity - (chr) activity performed
